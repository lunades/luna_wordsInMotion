HTML/CSS project by Elise Luna 

## Project Overview
This interactive project was designed to guide users through what I describe as the feeling of community. 

As you navigate through the pages, I wish to take you on a journey between the inner child and current self interacting contrastingly while also coexisting. 

Throughout my life, I found solace and joy in spaces where I could be my true, authentic self. In spaces where I feel I belong the most is essentially those that culminate a judgement free, fun environment; almost like those that are experienced in childhood.

As I'm navigating my 20s and adulting, I've come to appreciate those moments even more. There's something special about embracing our inner child and staying true to who we are, even as life pulls us in different directions. That's what this project is all about - celebrating authenticity and connection.

Using an excerpt from the song "Put Your Records On" by Corrine Bailey Rae, I've build this unique digital experience. Employing purely css knowledge and html, I found it challenging to avoid using explicit visuals when it came to storytelling. However, I feel it demonstrates my problem-solving, reasoning and creative skill as it has encouraged me to think outside the box of traditional UX.

## Technical Overview
I've made several design choices regarding the layout, typography, and animations of the project. 

As you make your way through, you will find there are hidden links which navigate you further into the project. I chose this detail to allude to the playfulness in not having a distinct structure and navigating something unfamiliar. You may find yourself searching for a way to move to the next page by hovering over various elements of the page. Users are indicated to click certain parts by small but discrete visual cues such as change of cursor, animations, shape, and color. 

Further, I chose to implement simple animations to bring even more liveliness to the aesthetic and experience for users. Some elements have more character than others. This was a design choice I made to demonstrate the contrast between playfulness and maturity to symbolize the intention and overall message of the project. Juxtaposing elements such as childlike handwritings, cursive fonts, and pastel colors with more standard fonts and muted colors further advanves the contrasting feeling I aimed for users to experience similarly juxtaposing the childlike personality with the mature self. 

Overall, these choices are what has compiled the experience users have when checking out my project. 

Hope you enjoy!
