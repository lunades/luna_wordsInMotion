# luna_wordsInMotion
Hello, you are invited to start "Words in Motion"! This interactive project is a blend of text and CSS magic to take you on a journey between your inner child and current self. 

Growing up, I found solace and joy in spaces where I could be my true, playful self. It's a feeling I wanted to capture and share with you in this project depicting the feeling of "community".

As I'm navigating my 20s and adulting, I've come to appreciate those moments even more. There's something special about embracing our inner child and staying true to who we are, even as life pulls us in different directions. That's what this project is all about - celebrating authenticity and connection.

I truly hope you enjoy this experience, let's begin!
