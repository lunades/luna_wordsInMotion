Coding project by Elise Luna 

## project overview
This interactive project was designed to guide users through what I describe as the feeling of community. 

As you navigate through the pages, I wish to take you on a journey between the inner child and current self interacting contrastingly while also coexisting. 

Throughout my life, I found solace and joy in spaces where I could be my true, authentic self. In spaces where I feel I belong the most is essentially those that culminate a judgement free, fun environment.

As I'm navigating my 20s and adulting, I've come to appreciate those moments even more. There's something special about embracing our inner child and staying true to who we are, even as life pulls us in different directions. That's what this project is all about - celebrating authenticity and connection.

## technical overview
This project is unique as I've used purely css knowledge and html to create this digital experience. I found it challenging to avoid using explicit visuals when it came to storytelling but this challenge encouraged me to think even more creatively. 

As you make your way through, you will find there are hidden links which navigate you further into the project. I chose this detail to allude to the playfulness in not having a distinct structure and navigating something unfamiliar. Further, I chose to implement simple animations to bring even more liveliness to the aesthetic and experience for users. 

Hope you enjoy!
